# Mighty 10tackle

Finally the time has come!!!. Two alien races of squares battle for the supremacy of the square race in the universe. The prize is the right to invade earth and kill the human race. Yummie! 

You are a humble green square willing to beat the despicable, merciless, unregrettable and a bit dummy, violet squares. You are afraid but you are not alone though. Two teams of 10 squares will fight to “Capture the Flag” of the enemy base (It is a game, but you know, this is how things are handled in the outer worlds).

Unluckily, every time you grab the flag you SHAPESHIFT in an attractive, juicy and irregular trapezoid. You should rely in your ability to return to your base and recover your appearance and INCREASE YOUR SCORE. 

How to Score: 
- 1 POINT if you pick the flag (yendor's amulet or whatever it is) in the enemy base. 
- 3 POINTS if you return to your base shapeshifted as trapezoid. 

Some tips during gameplay: 
- If you don't know where the enemy base is, follow the bullets. 
- You will hear a YOU WIN/YOU LOSE after a period of time (not shown on screen, as it is more fun). That means you have done a good/(surprisingly) bad job restraining the violet mighty attack. 

Controls: 
Arrow keys to move 
Space to shoot
